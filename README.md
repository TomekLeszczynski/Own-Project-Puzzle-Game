# General Info

Simple game app project focused on Javascript basic methods and DOM manipulations.

# Features

- A random image is divided into a grid of 3x3 / 6x6 / 9x9 cells. Each cell is rotated by a random angle (in increments of 90 degrees)
- The user can use the right/left arrow keys on the keyboard to rotate each cell and restore the original appearance of the image
- Each cell that is restored to its original angle loses the red border and changes its visibility
- Once all the cells are correctly aligned, the user hears a sound and sees a prompt indicating the end of the game
- Available keys: "play" / "reset"
- Single-player game
- Desktop only
